## 30. RXJS - The concatMap operator - Orderwise Subscribe to Inner Obs & Map their values | (Hindi)

## Youtube video [Link](https://youtu.be/KGqiMP9DE4g)

The **concapMap** operator in the **RxJS** is the **Higher-order Mapping operator** to work with **Higher order
Observables**. The concatMap operator subscribes to the **Inner Observables sequentially** and maps their values. This
operator is a combination of two operators **concat** and **map**. In this video, we will understand **concatMap** and
its use cases.
